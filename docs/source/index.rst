hgboost's documentation!
========================

``hgboost`` is short for Hyperoptimized Gradient Boosting and is a python package for hyperparameter optimization for xgboost, catboost and lightboost using cross-validation, and evaluating the results on an independent validation set.
``hgboost`` can be applied for classification and regression tasks.

``hgboost`` is fun because:

    * 1. Hyperoptimization of the Parameter-space using bayesian approach.
    * 2. Determines the best scoring model(s) using k-fold cross validation.
    * 3. Evaluates best model on independent evaluation set.
    * 4. Fit model on entire input-data using the best model.
    * 5. Works for classification and regression
    * 6. Creating a super-hyperoptimized model by an ensemble of all individual optimized models.
    * 7. Return model, space and test/evaluation results.
    * 8. Makes insightful plots.

Sponsor
=======
**This library is created and maintained in my free time**. I like to work on my open-source libraries, and you can help by becoming a sponsor! The easiest way is by simply following me on medium, and it will cost you nothing! Simply go to my `medium profile <https://erdogant.medium.com/>`_ and press "follow".
Read more on my `sponsor github page <https://github.com/sponsors/erdogant/>`_ why this is important. This also gives you various other ways to sponsor me!


Star is important too!
